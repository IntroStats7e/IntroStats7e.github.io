# Adoptions

The United States Census Bureau keeps track of the number of adoptions in each State (and Washington D.C.). The data includes the population of each state as well. How should adoptions be summarized and displayed?

The data are in `Adoptions.txt`

The variables in this dataset are: 

Header | Description
---|--------
`State` | Name of U.S. state 
`Adoptions` | Number of adoptions in 2014
`Population.2014.` | State population in 2014
`Adoptions.per.100000` | Adoptions per 100,000 population
