# Wildfires 2024

The National Interagency Fire Center reports statistics about wildfires. They report data from 1960, but the years 1960-1984 are so different from subsequent years that they can’t be analyzed together. These data are for 1985-2023. Is there a pattern over time? What is the relationship between the number of fires and the acres affected? Are fires getting larger or smaller on average?

The data are in `Wildfires_2024.txt`
