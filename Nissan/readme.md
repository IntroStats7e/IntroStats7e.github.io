# Nissan

Richard DeVeaux owned a Nissan Maxima for 8 years. He recorded the car’s fuel efficiency (in mpg) each time he filled the tank. He wanted to know what fuel efficiency to expect as “ordinary” for his car. Knowing this, he was able to predict when he’d need to fill the tank again and to notice if the fuel efficiency suddenly got worse, which could be a sign of trouble.
