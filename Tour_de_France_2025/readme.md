# Tour de France 2025

The Tour de France is the most famous bicycle race in the world. It has been run every year since 1903, except for a few during wars. The data report facts about the winners including age, time, distance, and average speed. Lance Armstrong's 7 consecutive victories been disqualified due to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, but his statistics are still included here.  Note that in some instances, the reported Average Speed does not match the intuitive calculation (distance divided by time). In 2025, this has to do with a one-off change to how time was recorded: the timer was stopped early due to weather and a highly technical final stage.
