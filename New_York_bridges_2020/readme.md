# New York bridges 2020

New York State inspectors assess all bridges in the state every two years including a bridge’s individual parts. Bridges are analyzed for their capacity to carry vehicular loads. Inspectors are required to evaluate, assign a condition score, and document the condition of up to 47 structural elements, including rating 25 components of each span of a bridge, in addition to general components common to all bridges. Recently, the NYSDOT changed from recording bridge condition on a seven point scale (see New York State bridges 2016) to a Poor/OK scale, recorded here as Poor (Y/N) or Poor01 (1 = Poor; 0 = OK)  How does the condition of the bridge relate to its age? Are there any outliers? Can you account for them by identifying them?
