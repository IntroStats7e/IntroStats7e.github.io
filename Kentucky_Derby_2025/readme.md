# Kentucky Derby 2025

The Kentucky Derby is a horse race that has been run every year since 1875 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. The race started as a 1.5-mile race, but in 1896, it was shortened to 1.25 miles because experts felt that 3-year-old horses shouldn’t run such a long race so early in the season. It had been run in May every year but one—1901—when it took place on April 29. However, due to the COVID pandemic, the race was postponed until September 4, 2020. Since then, it has returned to its traditional May date.
