# Fish diet

Medical researchers followed 6272 Swedish men for 30 years to see whether there was any association between the amount of fish in their diet and prostate cancer. The original study actually used pairs of twins, which enabled the researchers to discern that the risk of cancer for those who never ate fish actually was substantially greater.
