# Winter Olympics 2022 Mens Alpine Combined

The men’s super combined skiing event consists of two races: a downhill and a slalom. Thirty seven skiers finished both races. Times for the two events are added together, and the skier with the lowest total time wins. There is ongoing debate whether this format favors the technical slalom skiers or the downhill specialists.
