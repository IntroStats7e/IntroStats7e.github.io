# Male body measurements

Measurements of 250 men of various ages. The percent of a man’s body that is fat is a matter of concern for health and fitness. But the %bodyfat is difficult and expensive to measure accurately. These data offer correct %bodyfat measurements along with a variety of easier to find measures. Can you build a model to predict the %bodyfat from other, more easily made, measurements?
