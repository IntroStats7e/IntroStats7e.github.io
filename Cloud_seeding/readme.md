# Cloud seeding

In an experiment to determine whether seeding clouds with silver iodide increases rainfall, 52 clouds were randomly assigned to be seeded or not. The amount of rain they generated was then measured (in acre-feet).

The data are in `Cloud_seeding.txt`

The variables in this dataset are: 

Header | Description
---|--------
`Unseeded.Clouds` | Rainfall from unseeded clouds (acre-feet) 
`Seeded.Clouds` | Rainfall from clouds seeded with silver iodide (acre-feet)
