# AI in healthcare

A 2025 paper examined patient attitudes toward the use of AI in health care around the world. Respondents were recruited primarily from hospital waiting rooms and therefore likely over-represent urban, tech-literate, and higher socioeconomic status populations. These data show the answer to the question "How much confidence do you have that AI can improve health care?" for survey respondents from the Global North and the Global South. 

The data are in `AI_in_healthcare.txt`

The variables in this dataset are: 

Header | Description
---|--------
`Global.North.South` | Whether the respondent lives in the Global North or the Global South
`AI.Improve.Healthcare` | Respondent's level of confidence that AI can improve health care
