# Fuel economy 2026

The U.S. government provides fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and other information about late model cars sold in the US. This dataset includes 1078 vehicles. How would you model the relationship between fuel economy and engine displacement (in liters)? Are there any cars that don’t fit the model? Can you explain why?

The data are in `Fuel_economy_2026.txt`
