# Nightmares

Researchers  interviewed participants to find some who reliably fell asleep and awoke on one side and who could remember their dreams. They found 63 participants, of whom 41 were right-side sleepers and 22 slept on their left side. Then they interviewed them about their dreams. Of the 41 right-side sleepers, only 6 reported often having nightmares. But of the 22 left-side sleepers 9 reported nightmares. Is the difference significant?
